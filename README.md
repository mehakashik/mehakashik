<h2>Education </h2>

- Concordia University (M.Engg) : Information Systems Security <br>
- Gujarat Technological University (B.Engg) : information and Communication Technology

<h2>Experience</h2>

- Cybersecurity Mentorship Intern, Risk Stifle | Halifax, Nova Scotia
  An active participant in a mentorship program led by a Senior Infosec professional with over 18 years of experience across diverse domains, including nuclear plants, airports, consultancy, and critical infrastructure. Through this mentorship initiative, I gained insights into cybersecurity practices within a realistic industry setting. It facilitated my comprehension of security controls, threat risk assessment, threat modeling, the NIST framework, and penetration testing tools.

  The mentorship program provided hands-on learning in a virtual environment, mirroring an actual industry setup. We delved into various risk scenarios and learned how to manage risks associated with each scenario through multiple workshops effectively. I now feel confident in handling endpoint controls and am well-versed in enterprise security controls and practices. This ongoing learning journey enables me to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity practices and frameworks, adopting a practical approach tailored for enterprise-level security.

  Projects Under the Program 
  - Risk assessment of a web portal. 
  - Penetration testing of different websites. 
  - Secure the cloud environment for a client. 
  - Managed project with Agile methodologies
  - Tuned the PAM environment with CyberArk tool.
  - Implement the NIST 800-53 controls for compliance with NIST framework.
  - Malware Analysis.
  - Vulnerability management using tools Nessus & Rapid 7.
